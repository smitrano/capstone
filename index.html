			 			<p><b>Method workers paid are paid over 40% above living wage.</b></p>

			 			<p><b>Why it's good for Method:</b> Paying employees a living wage is more beneficial than the money saved by paying them less. Goldman Sachs found that "there is a high correlation across all sectors in terms of cash flow generated relative to payroll per employee." The report goes on to say that this finding "breaks with the common prconception of improving operational efficiency through cutting payroll and, on the contrary, seems to suggest that companies that invest in their workforce will reap exponential benefits."</p>

			 			<p><b>Why it's good for Method:</b> This investment reduces absenteeism and turnover, and increases productivity. These gains more than cover the cost of providing these benefits.</p>

			 			<p><b>Why it's good for Method:</b> Creating service opportunities for employees is good for business. The Center for Corporate Citizenship at Boston College reports that employee volunteer programs enhance attraction, recruitment, and skills as well as a company's image in the community. According to the study Good Companies, Better Employeers, employee volunteer programs increase positive word of mouth from employees about their employers, improve worker satisfaction, and increase employee retention rates.</p>

			 			<p><b>Bottles are made from 100% recycled plastic.</b></p>

			 			<p><b>Why it's good for Method:</b> While the free market economist would argue that Method pays a premium for recycled material, which is true, the premium is far outweighed by the financial benefit. When oil prices spiked in 2011, nearly all of Method's competitors were forced to raise prices to cover inflated commodity costs. Because post-consumer plastic is far less carbon intense, as are most ingredients in method products, Method was able to hold its pricing. This resulted in market share gains and revenue growth 20 times the cost of the better materials. These gains have sustained, and even now with lower commodity prices, Method's recycled plastic costs essentially the same as virgin plastic.</p>

			 	<p> At the time that co-founders Ryan and Lowry decided to reimagine the most prosaic of household items--cleaning supplies--large corporations like Procter & Gamble and Clorox dominated the market with fairly generic products that contained harsh, toxic chemicals. To find a foothold in the market, Method had to differentiate itself.</p>
			 	<p>Method products, Ryan and Lowry decided, would be environmentally friendly and would feature elegant packaging. "Method has to enter a category with a huge disruption," Alastair Dorward, then Method's CEO, told Inc. in 2007. "The story cannot be copied overnight or eroded by existing [companies]. It has to have disruptive packaging, ingredients, and fragrance." </p>
			 	<p> San Francisco Equity, prior to a 2005 spinoff from LMS Capital, had invested $475,000 in the company in 2003, and contributed another $4 million in late 2004. Simon Equity had invested around $1 million in the company in 2001, and has committed additional equity since. The company raised $25 million in committed capital, Dow Jones previousy reported. Tim Koogle, former head of Yahoo, was also a large investor.</p>
				<p>Since SFEP's initial investment, Method's sales have grown over 400%, according to the firm. European manufacturer Ecover purchased the home-care products maker for an undisclosed sum from San Francisco Equity Partners in September 2012, a transition that co-founder Eric Ryan described as "a new chapter in the evolution of our business." </p>

			<hr>
			<p style="padding-top: 20px;"><b>A collaboration between four close friends, Warby Parker was conceived as an alternative to the overpriced and bland eyewear available today.</b></p> 

			<p>Prescription eyewear simply should not cost $300+. The industry is controlled by a few large companies that have kept prices artificially high, reaping huge profits from consumers who have no other options. By circumventing traditional channels and engaging with customers directly through their website, Warby Parker is able to provide high-quality, beautifully designed prescription eyewear for only $95.</p>

			<h3>Even at $95, there are almost a billion people without access to glasses, so for every pair sold, Warby Parker provides one to someone in need.</h3> 
		 	
		 	<p>Being a B Corporation allows Warby Parker to account for the commitments they are making to their customers, their employees, the environment and the community at large.</p>
