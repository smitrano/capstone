			<h2>Warby Parker</h2>
			<hr>
			<p style="padding-top: 20px;"><b>A collaboration between four close friends, Warby Parker was conceived as an alternative to the overpriced and bland eyewear available today.</b></p> 

			<p>Prescription eyewear simply should not cost $300+. The industry is controlled by a few large companies that have kept prices artificially high, reaping huge profits from consumers who have no other options. By circumventing traditional channels and engaging with customers directly through their website, Warby Parker is able to provide high-quality, beautifully designed prescription eyewear for only $95.</p>

			<h3>Even at $95, there are almost a billion people without access to glasses, so for every pair sold, Warby Parker provides one to someone in need.</h3> 
		 	
		 	<p>Being a B Corporation allows Warby Parker to account for the commitments they are making to their customers, their employees, the environment and the community at large.</p>
